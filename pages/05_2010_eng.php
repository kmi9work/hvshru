The critical task of a current school is forming a human personality as a bearer of humanistic views, and the idea of tolerance in interethnic relations. Tolerant culture is multifold, and it is necessary to build up educational space, taking into consideration at least three components as minimum: readiness of administration of an educational institution to assist teachers in their efforts towards application of the pedagogics of tolerance to the school culture, tolerance of teachers both external and internal, and perception of educational environment by students as tolerant.

It is necessary to drive an academic process via organization of own cognitive activity of students. For it to be organized in a right way it is necessary in every subject to mark out specific types of activity, which are genetic for a given sphere of a human cognition.

The methodology of teaching pupils to compose equations of an ionic exchange in electrolytes based on the theory of stage-by-stage (planned) formation of intellectual actions and concepts, according to the activity approach for teaching is discussed here. Components of the skill were determined and then the methodical and teaching complete set including schemes of orientation basis of activity and system of exercises for necessary skills formation were developed. Moreover, the modified range of acids strength was proposed that allows defining products of chemical reactions with multibasic acids and salts, and with acid- similar organic substances.

I suggest the formulation of the first lesson of Chemistry in the 8th form. This lesson should show the children, that Chemistry is an interesting, fascinating subject, but at the same time it demands serious attitude, hard work. At the lesson lots of different forms of work with the pupils are used: discussion, quizzes, games, laboratory tests, demonstrational experiments, stories, displays of video clips. The lesson is accompanied by the computer presentation, displays of video clips of the history of the science, the staging.

It is shown that the well known reaction, described in many textbooks, has a number of special features and can be the object of interesting experimental research, which completely on the forces to students, who study elementary chemistry. A series of the represented experiment is aimed for overcoming of formalism in the chemical knowledge of students, development of their skill to observe and to explain the essence of the phenomena, development of their critical thinking. The results, obtained by students, successfully will agree with literature data and convincingly prove the need for integral approach to the studied processes.
