Isoelectronic particles help to study the molecules structure. The usefulness of the conception of isoelectronic molecules, ions, and crystal structures in the study of chemical bounds, as well as the structure and properties of inorganic and organic compounds, had been proved. The isoelectronic series of particles with one, two and three atoms of the elements of the second period of the periodic table of elements had been considered. Inside one of a series the difference in the electronic structure, associated with the delocalization of electrons of π-bonds, can arise. Attention is paid to the similarity of electronic structures of molecules of ozone, formate ion and nitro-group.

High rates of scientific and technical growth, dilative information space dictate the necessity of developing human abilities of self-learning and independent decision-making. Well-developed organizational skills not only increase activity of comprehension, reducing the required time, but also determine a possibility of involving students into the process of self-education. To form organizational skills it is necessary to include special methods into the learning process, to create conditions to show an active position of students, which will govern the necessity to organize one’s own educational activity.

Problem of using visual methods for effective teaching of chemistry is examined in this paper. We’ve come to solving the above mentioned problem from the position of revealing student’s cognitive styles. This hypothesis formed by us, means that to improve the results of teaching chemistry teachers should begin with visual methods and organize student’s practice in their acquaintance with objects and phenomenon they master. Experimental control confirmed our hypothesis. It allowed us to reveal a part of students (14% at school and 29% at gymnasium) that were not sensitive enough to the order of information presentation.

Use of information technologies, including technologies of multimedia and distance technologies, at the lessons of chemistry contributes to the cognitive interest of pupils, enhances the quality of Learning and permits to construct individual educational trajectories of students. During 2005-2009 performed work on the development and implementation in schools Chkalovsky district of Yekaterinburg information environment of distance learning. Distance learning course in chemistry is structured in line with the functionality of the distance learning system and includes 200 shots, including 30 schemes, 25 figures, 6 tests, 12 research jobs, animation clips illustrating themes, challenging the understanding by pupils, such as «The structure of the ethylene molecule. SP2 hybridization» and «Recognition of ethylene using a solution of potassium permanganate or bromine water». Results of the pilot implementation of distance learning course of general chemistry in schools of Yekaterinburg indicate increased motivation to study chemistry.

Introduction of the Unified State Examination in chemistry as the final form of certification, today does not solve this problem as control and measuring materials do not meet the requirements of reliability, validity that is why do not allow to receive objective estimations of a level of pupils’ knowledge. This problem is discussed with the framework of G. Rush one-parametrical model of the control and measuring materials demonstration version of the Unified State Examination in chemistry for 2009 taken as an example.

Nucleic acids are studied in chemistry and biology school courses. Often student study these topics at different times, and each of those disciplines provides an opportunity to consider DNA and RNA from different standpoints, without creating an integrated idea regarding an object being studied meanwhile. The organization of an integrated lesson allows avoiding such disadvantages. Chemistry and biology are two disciplines, which form deliberate attitude towards the outward things, elementary competence in every-day issues and a safe position towards many situations, which humanity encounters at the present time.

The idea of amphotericity (amphoterism) has taken its strong roots in chemistry in the way of ability of matters to reveal their ambivalent nature in chemical reactions. As a rule, ambivalence means that the same matter behaves both an acid as a base as well depending on a type of the second reagent. The authors have designed a variant of the experience, which proves ambivalence of amino acids behavior. Its main point is that regarding reagents, which alkali and acid are, an amino acid is taken in plenty.
