That’s why the authors offer to examine the behavior of inorganic compounds of the main classes at the empirical level first, then to say, and only after that to put them into a symbolic shape (to form reaction equations). That allows to decrease a number of abstract ideas and symbolic and graphical means at the first stages of studying chemistry, and, therefore, to facilitate the intussusception of chemical ideas.</p>
