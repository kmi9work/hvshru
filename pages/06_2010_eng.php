Problems of education (mainly of science  and  math  education in  secondary
school) in the USSR (1950-1991) and in the Russian Federation  are  reviewed
in the context of the State Laws and real results, including  exams.  It  is
concluded that in 1970s the level of training take a turn to  the  worse  in
comparison  with  50s   and   particularly   the   gap   between   secondary
and education at university level became much higher.  The  reason  of  such
situation is discussed in detail.
