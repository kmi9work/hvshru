Requirements, set by modern society, are achieved by new ways of selection contents and organization of education processes such as integrative – differentiated, topical, pragmatist approach.
Special role is given to the use of competence approach in teaching chemistry. The Most important factors for successful life of a man are key competences: problem solving, communication skills, information. Those standard tasks are the basis for development of creativity, ability for self-education, provide functional literacy, social adaptation. Content and Process of education can be foundation for formation of key competences of graduated students.

Digital (computer) laboratory (DL) is the set of the training equipment for new generation, which actively takes root in the practice of contemporary school. Its application makes it possible to diversify training chemical experiment, to give more than attention to the quantitative assessment of the studied phenomenon. At the same time, there are objective reasons, which limit use DL in the school chemical formation. On the basis of the systems analysis of the revealed problems are developed and approved the systematic principles of effective use DL in the lessons.
